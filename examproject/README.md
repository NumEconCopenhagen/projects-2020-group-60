We solve the three given tasks using different methods.

**Task 1, Human Capital**
We make a lot of different functions that describes both utility and labor. We also plot a lot of these function to show evolution graphically. Furthermore we use scipy optimize to solve some tasks.

**Task 2, AS-AD model**
We start of by using sympy to solve the model symbolically. Then we convert the symbolic solution into a function from which we test and plot various things. We use numpy to investigate some statistics of our simulated model, and round it all of with using a numerical solver to solve for specific values.

**Task 3, Exchange economy**
This task is primarily solved with numpy and pandas DataFrames. The tasks are primarily solved by defining functions, and plotting the results using DataFrames. We also create interactive plots using widgets, to give a better flow and interpretation of the results.
