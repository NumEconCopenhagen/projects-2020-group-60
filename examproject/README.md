Linear regression: Estimating and plotting a linear regression, and estimating with two different solvers, which we plot. 
In this exercise, we learned how to solve a linear regression with different methods and plotting the results.

Durable purchases: Finding and plotting different functions in the household problem. In this exercise we learned how to solve different periods in an economic model and lastly how to analyze an extension of a model with a piecewise function.

Gradient descent: Implementing an algorithm for finding a minimum in a function. In this exercise, we learned how to step by step constructing a well-functioning algorithm where we check for convergence running and more in a while-loop. Also, we got to know a lot about the Jacobian.
