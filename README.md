# Group-60

This portfolio is a collection of 3 projects and 1 exam project.

Project (0) - Inaugural Project: Solve and optimize a simple economic model of labour supply. In this project we learned the basics of creating an optimizer to solve economic problems.
Project (1) - Data Project: Datafetching and -cleaning process for an economic analyzis of pension funds and the OMXC share index. In this project we learned to fetch data and gradually clean it to a prefered finalized table.
Project (2) - Model Project: Solve choosen economic models using numerical and analytical methods and displaying results. In this project we learned to calculate and display economic models and how to use the optimizers available.


##The Exam Project:## 

Linear regression: Estimating and plotting a linear regression, and estimating with two different solvers, which we plot. 
In this exercise, we learned how to solve a linear regression with different methods and plotting the results.

Durable purchases: Finding and plotting different functions in the household problem. In this exercise we learned how to solve different periods in an economic model and lastly how to analyze an extension of a model with a piecewise function.

Gradient descent: Implementing an algorithm for finding a minimum in a function. In this exercise, we learned how to step by step constructing a well-functioning algorithm where we check for convergence running and more in a while-loop. Also, we got to know a lot about the Jacobian.
