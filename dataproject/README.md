# Data analysis project

In this Project we want to examine the correlation between the total assets of pension funds in Denmark and the share index, in the period 2000-2016. We expect to find a strong correlation between these variables, as equity tends to be the largest form of assets pension funds own. A higher share index would increase the value of the shareholders equity thereby increasing the amount of total assets of pension funds.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

This **loades two datasets**:

We got the share index from https://www.statbank.dk/MPK13
We got pension funds from https://www.statbank.dk/MPK49

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
